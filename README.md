# Archival Object - Character, Place, & Simulation
This is a WebGL application of an archival project I created for Character, Place, & Simulation (MAGI @ RMIT University). 

It is an interactive world containing 8 different objects created weekly over the semester and works on both PC and mobile devices on any WebGL supported browser.
